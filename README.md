This magic brain App will connect the dots and detect faces in your pictures. Just paste in an image URL and give it a try.
(it doesn't collect the login data yet, that functionality will be developed in the future).

Built with CRA, this App uses the Clarifai API - Face detection AI technology [https://www.clarifai.com].
